## SpotifyAPI.Web

### Initialization

In `5.x`, a new `SpotifyWebAPI` instance could be created without supplying necessary values, since they were implemented as properties. With `6.x`, necessary values have to be given in the constructor and `SpotifyWebAPI` has been renamed to `SpotifyClient`. Also, `SpotifyClientConfig` has been introduced to give a better configuration experience, including retry handlers, automatic authenticators and proxy configurations.

```csharp
// OLD
var spotify = new SpotifyWebAPI { AccessToken = "YourAccessToken" };
var spotify = new SpotifyWebAPI(ProxyConfig); // No access token - invalid

// NEW
var spotify = new SpotifyClient("YourAccessToken");

var config = SpotifyClientConfig
  .CreateDefault()
  .WithToken("YourAccessToken");
var spotify = new SpotifyClient(config);

var config = SpotifyClientConfig
  .CreateDefault()
  .WithAuthenticator(new ClientCredentialsAuthenticator(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)); // takes care of access tokens
var spotify = new SpotifyClient(config);
```

For some performance guides, have a look at the [Configuration Guide](./configuration.md)

### Proxy

In `5.x`, the proxy configuration could be passed to the `SpotifyWebAPI` constructor. In `6.x`, they're part of the HTTP Client. The built-in http client supports proxies out of the box:

```csharp
var httpClient = new NetHttpClient(new ProxyConfig("localhost", 8080)
{
  User = "",
  Password = "",
  SkipSSLCheck = false,
});
var config = SpotifyClientConfig
  .CreateDefault()
  .WithHTTPClient(httpClient);

var spotify = new SpotifyClient(config);
```

### Calling API Endpoints

In `5.x`, there was one big instance to support all API endpoints. Parameters to these endpoints were passed directly as method parameters. Optional parameters were nullable and could be excluded. In `6.x`, every endpoint group (`albums`, `tracks`, `userprofile`) has their own API-Client, which is available as a property in a `SpotifyClient` instance. While URI path parameters are still passed as method parameter, query and body parameters are now passed as a grouped class instance, where required parameters are needed in the constructor and optional parameters can be supplied as properties. All endpoints are also only implemented as async methods.

```csharp
// OLD:
PrivateProfile profile = await spotify.GetPrivateProfileAsync();
var playlists = await spotify.GetUserPlaylists(profile.Id, 100, 0);

// NEW:
PrivateUser user = await spotify.UserProfile.Current();
var playlists = await spotify.Playlists.GetUsers(user.Id, new PlaylistGetUsersRequest
{
  Limit = 100,
  Offset = 0
});
```

All required arguments are checked for non-null values. If it's null, the methods will throw a `ArgumentNullException`

### Error/Header Handling

In `5.x`, all response models included a base error model, with properties like `Headers`, `Error` and `HasError`. This was not a good decision since response models should be clean and only contain API response data. In `6.x`, error handling is `Exception` based. For example, if the access token is invalid, calling API endpoints will throw a `APIUnauthorizedException`. If you hit the API too many times, the method will throw a `APITooManyRequestsException`. They all derive from a base exception `APIException`, which is also thrown in more general cases, e.g bad request input parameters. If you're interested in the headers of the last response, you can use `spotify.LastResponse`, **make sure there is only one thread using this instance!**

```csharp
// OLD:
PrivateProfile profile = await spotify.GetPrivateProfileAsync();
if(profile.HasError())
{
  // handle error
}
var headers = profile.Headers(); // access to headers

// NEW:
try
{
    PrivateProfile profile = await spotify.GetPrivateProfileAsync();
    var response = spotify.LastResponse; // response.Headers
}
catch (APIUnauthorizedException e)
{
  // handle unauthorized error
  // e.Response contains HTTP response
  // e.Message contains Spotify error message
}
catch (APIException e)
{
  // handle common error
  // e.Response contains HTTP response
  // e.Message contains Spotify error message
}
```

## SpotifyAPI.Web.Auth

In `5.x`, `SpotifyAPI.Web.Auth` contained every logic related to the OAuth flows. In `6.x`, `SpotifyAPI.Web.Auth` is only required if you need a HTTP Server for handling OAuth responses. For example, if you're in a ASP.NET environment or just use the [Client Credentials](client_credentials) flow, there is no need to install `SpotifyAPI.Web.Auth` anymore.

### Authorization Code Auth

As an example, this shows how to convert a `5.x` authorization code flow to `6.x`:

```csharp
// OLD
var auth =
  new AuthorizationCodeAuth(_clientId, _secretId, "http://localhost:4002", "http://localhost:4002",
    Scope.PlaylistReadPrivate | Scope.PlaylistReadCollaborative);
auth.AuthReceived += AuthOnAuthReceived;
auth.Start();
auth.OpenBrowser();

private static async void AuthOnAuthReceived(object sender, AuthorizationCode payload)
{
  var auth = (AuthorizationCodeAuth) sender;
  auth.Stop();

  Token token = await auth.ExchangeCode(payload.Code);
  var spotify = new SpotifyWebAPI { AccessToken = token.AccessToken };
  await PrintUsefulData(spotify);
}

// NEW
var config = SpotifyClientConfig.CreateDefault();
var server = new EmbedIOAuthServer(new Uri("http://localhost:5000/callback"), 5000);
server.AuthorizationCodeReceived += async (sender, response) =>
{
  await server.Stop();
  var tokenResponse = await new OAuthClient(config).RequestToken(new AuthorizationCodeTokenRequest(
    _clientId, _secretId, response.Code, server.BaseUri
  ));

  var spotify = new SpotifyClient(config.WithToken(tokenResponse.AccessToken));
}
await server.Start();

var loginRequest = new LoginRequest(server.BaseUri, _clientId, LoginRequest.ResponseType.Code)
{
  Scope = new[] { Scopes.PlaylistReadPrivate, Scopes.PlaylistReadCollaborative }
};
BrowserUtil.Open(loginRequest.ToUri());
```

While it is more code to write, there is a better seperation of concerns. For example, it is able to construct a `LoginRequest` without starting a server. This `LoginRequest` can also be used to forward the user to in a web-based context. The same auth server `EmbedIOAuthServer` can be used to receive `AuthorizationCodes` and `ImplictGrants` responses.
